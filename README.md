# Credit-Card-Fraud-Analysis

This analysis was carried out on the transactions done by 25 cardholders during the span of 2018 - 2019 along with the merchant's analysis where
they spent the money. 

Assumption 1: A pattern of small transactions(< $2) followed by large transactions depicts fraudulent operations

Assumption 2: Large transactions (> $1000) at hotels or business meeting locations on weekends are sign of fraudulent operations

Observation 1: Large transactions were made mostly during the morning time (7 A.M - 9 A.M), most frequently by card holder 1 

Observation 2: Card holders 2, 18 and 25 account for about 13% of total small transactions followed by a large transaction

Observation 3: Wood and Baker Inc are under potential threats where major number of small transactions were made over the span of 1 year

To confirm the observations about card holders 2,18 and 25, the data about who are the authorized users of those cards and what are their spending 
patterns would be required. This analysis helps to analyze and warn the credit card users about the unobserved and repitative spending patterns on 
their card to maintain precaution.
